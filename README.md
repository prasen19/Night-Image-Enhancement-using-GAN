**Low light image enhancement** is one of the **challenging tasks** in **computer vision**, and
it becomes more difficult when images are very dark. Recently, most of low light image
enhancement work is done either on synthetic data or on the images which considerably
visible. **We propose** a **new method to enhance real-world night-time images**, which are
**dark** and **noisy**. **The proposed method consists of two pairs of Generator - Discriminator.**
Moreover, the **proposed method enhances dark shades and removes noise** up to a much
extent, with **natural-looking colors** in the **output image**. **Experimental results** evaluation
of the proposed method on the **”See In the Dark dataset” demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed model** compared with other **state-of-the-art methods**. The proposed method
yields comparable **better results** on **qualitative** and **quantitative** assessments when compared
with the existing methods.

## The following images shows some results of our method on See In The Dark Dataset.
