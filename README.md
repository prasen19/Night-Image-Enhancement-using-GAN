## Abstract 

**Low light image enhancement** is one of the **challenging tasks** in **computer vision**, and
it becomes more difficult when images are very dark. Recently, most of the low-light image
enhancement work is done either on synthetic data or on the images which considerably
visible. **We propose** a **new method to enhance real-world night-time images**, which are
**dark** and **noisy**. **The proposed method consists of two pairs of Generator-Discriminator.**
Moreover, the **proposed method enhances dark shades and removes noise** up to a much
extent, with **natural-looking colors** in the **output image**. **Experimental results** evaluation
of the proposed method on the **”See In the Dark dataset” demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed model** compared with other **state-of-the-art methods**. The proposed method
yields comparable **better results** on **qualitative** and **quantitative** assessments when compared
with the existing methods.
